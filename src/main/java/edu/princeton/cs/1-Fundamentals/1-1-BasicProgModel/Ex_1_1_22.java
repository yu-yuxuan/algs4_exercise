// 1.1.22 Write a version of BinarySearch that uses the recursive rank() given on page
// 25 and traces the method calls. Each time the recursive method is called, print the argument values lo and hi, indented by the depth of the recursion. Hint: Add an argument
//     to the recursive method that keeps track of the depth.
