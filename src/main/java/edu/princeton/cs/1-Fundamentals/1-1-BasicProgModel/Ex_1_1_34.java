// Filtering. Which of the following require saving all the values from standard
// input (in an array, say), and which could be implemented as a filter using only a fixed
//     number of variables and arrays of fixed size (not dependent on N)? For each, the input
//     comes from standard input and consists of N real numbers between 0 and 1.
//     * Print the maximum and minimum numbers.
//     * Print the median of the numbers.
//     * Print the k th smallest value, for k less than 100.
//     * Print the sum of the squares of the numbers.
//     * Print the average of the N numbers.
//     * Print the percentage of numbers greater than the average.
//     * Print the N numbers in increasing order.
//     * Print the N numbers in random order.
