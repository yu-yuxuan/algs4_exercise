// Equal keys. Add to BinarySearch a static method rank() that takes a key and
//     a sorted array of int values (some of which may be equal) as arguments and returns the
//     number of elements that are smaller than the key and a similar method count() that
//     returns the number of elements equal to the key. Note : If i and j are the values returned
//     by rank(key, a) and count(key, a) respectively, then a[i..i+j-1] are the values in
//     the array that are equal to key.
